# very-simple-coin-flip
A minimal application to flip a virtual coin - because why should it take 30 seconds to load a website just to flip a stupid coin?
The source code is minified because I had originally made this code to be embedded in a base64 URL so I didn't have to host it. I didn't want the URL to be even more ridiculously long by added purely aesthetic charcters.
